  <section id="motivation">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) provides terms to annotate and categorise instances of legally compliant personal data handling. In particular, the vocabulary provides <code>LegalBasis</code> and <code>DataSubjectRight</code> as top-level concepts representing the various legal bases for justifying processing of personal data and rights provided to the data subject respectively. Since these concepts are specifically defined within the scope of jurisdictional laws, their implementation is provided as a separate vocabulary that extends the DPV, thereby permitting continued usage of DPV as a jurisdiction-agnostic and generic vocabulary.</p>
    <p>The DPV-GDPR vocabulary extends the concepts within DPV regarding <a href="#vocab-legal-basis">legal bases</a>, <a href="#vocab-rights">data subject rights</a>, <a href="#vocab-data-transfers">data transfer tools</a>, <a href="#vocab-DPIA">data protection impact assessment (DPIA)</a>, and <a href="#vocab-compliance">compliance</a>, and provides a compatible extension to be used in combination with the DPV to represent GDPR-specific information.</p>
  </section>
{% endblock INTRODUCTION %}
{% block VOCAB %}
  <section id="vocab-legal-basis">
    <h2>Legal Basis under GDPR</h2>
    <p>The GDPR Article 6 specifies that it is mandatory for every processing to have one (or more) legal basis that justifies its compliance. These are represented as <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-GDPR">Core Legal Basis</a>. In addition, Articles 9 legal basis are represented as <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-special">legal basis for Special Category Personal Data</a>, and those from Articles 45, 46, and 49 are represented as <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-data-transfer">legal basis for Data Transfer</a>.</p>
    <div class="note" title="DPV does not define validity of legal basis">
      <p>DPV and DPV-GDPR only define the legal basis as concepts, and do not define or provide information associated with their validity. For example, determining whether consent is valid, or the appropriateness of a legal basis for its application in a use-case. The DPVCG is interested in providing such "helpful assistance" through semantics, and welcomes discussions and contributions for the same.</p>

  <section id="vocab-rights">
    <h2>Rights under GDPR</h2>
    <p>GDPR provides several rights to the data subject, whose applicability depends on the context and nature of processing taking place. DPV lists these rights at an abstract level as concepts along with their origin in specific clauses of the GDPR.</p>
    <p>In addition to DPV's concepts regarding exercise of rights, DPV-GDPR provides additional concepts specific to the implementation of its rights. For example, [=SARNotice=] refers to the information provided in fulfilment of [=A15=] Right of Access, or using <a href="#rights-dcat:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> to represent the dataset provided in fulfilment of [=A20=] Right to Data Portability.</p>

  <section id="vocab-data-transfers">
    <h2>Data Transfer Tools</h2>
    <p>GDPR regulates data transfers outside the EU/EEA based on jurisdictions the transfer is occurring within and the guarantees available regarding the protection of personal data and fundamental rights. To indicate the sufficiency of a data transfer being compatible and adherent to these requirements, the European Commission provides various 'data transfer tools' based on the legal bases provided within the GDPR. DPV-GDPR models these as follows.</p>

    <div class="note" title="Providing implementations of Data Transfer Tools">
      <p>The DPV-GDPR's concepts for transfer tools are currently symbolic, and do not provide a way to actually implement those tools. For example, to represent the information contained within a SCC or BCR. The DPVCG is interested in providing such implementations, and welcomes discussions and contributions for the same.</p>
    </div>

    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['data_transfers']['classes']) }}
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-DPIA">
    <h2>DPIA</h2>
    <p>[[GDPR]] Article 35 specifies the conditions and requirements associated with Data Protection Impact Assessments. DPV-GDPR expands on the <code>DPIA</code> concept defined as an Organisational Measure within DPV by considering a DPIA as consisting of the following iterative process, and providing statuses for documenting their progression and outputs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identifying activities for which a DPIA is to be undertaken (represented using DPV and DPV-GDPR)</li>
      <li>Checking whether a DPIA is needed as per GDPR Art.35 and other jurisdictional requirements: the activitiy is [=DPIANecessityAssessment=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIANecessityStatus=]</li>
      <li>Conducting the DPIA to identify risks and impacts: the activity is [=DPIAProcedure=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIARiskStatus=]</li>
      <li>Determining the outcome based on risk mitigation: the activity is [=DPIAOutcome=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIAOutcomeStatus=]</li>
      <li>Determining whether processing should be permitted to continue or be carried out, with the outcome being denote using [=DPIAProcessingRecommendation=]</li>
      <li>Assessing whether processing is carried out in conformance with the DPIA, with the outcome being denoted using [=DPIAConformity]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to DPV's concepts for representing information about processing of personal data, DPV-GDPR also recommends using [[[DCT]]] concepts to represent <a href="#dpia-properties">relevant metadata</a>, such as dates, identifiers, validity, etc.</p>
    <div class="note" title="Guidance on documenting DPIAs using DPV and DPV-GDPR">
      <p>The DPVCG is working on updating the [[[DPV-GUIDE-GDPR-DPIA]]] based on recent updates in DPV and DPV-GDPR. In addition to these, we are also working on providing concepts for expressing impacts and risk management within [[[RISK]]].</p>

  <section id="vocab-compliance">
    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    <p>The concepts in this section reflect the status of processing operations being in <i>compliance with GDPR</i>, by extending the <code>ComplianceStatus</code> from DPV for GDPR. It does not define the requirements for compliance itself.</p>
