<h3 id=t01>DPV Maintainence</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>see live version at <a href="https://harshp.com/dpv/dpv/">https://<wbr>harshp.com/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>dpv/</a></p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>paul has reviewed purposes (<a href="https://harshp.com/dpv/dpv/modules/purposes">https://<wbr>harshp.com/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>modules/<wbr>purposes</a>) and TOMs (<a href="https://harshp.com/dpv/dpv/modules/TOM">https://<wbr>harshp.com/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>modules/<wbr>TOM</a>) - some issues with expand/collapse buttons being confusing where there are no collapsible lists; broken links;</p>

<h3 id=t02>Multilingual DPV</h3>
<p id=x014 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/89">Issue 89</a></strong>  Multi-lingual labels and descriptions for concepts (by coolharsh55) </p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>Question is how to present these in the HTML documents? Open to suggestions or best practices that we can adopt. Otherwise the 'default' option is to provide some language selector on the page, and to have different versions of the page for languages.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Service new concept</h3>
<p id=x017 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/124">Issue 124</a></strong>  Add dpv:Service as a concept (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>discussed whether to accept this; delaram will discuss implications of the concept and roles for 'AI System as a Service' next week</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>ISO 22989 AI terms</h3>
<p id=x020 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/110">Issue 110</a></strong> Add concepts from ISO 22989:2022 AI Terminology (by coolharsh55) </p>
<p id=x021 class=summary>okay to look into for comments and how they can support DPV concepts</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>mark raised the point about using only legal concepts; harsh mentioned sources for concepts in DPV are authoritative sources which includes both law and standards. For specific legal concepts it is suggested to represent them in extensions.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Datasheets/Model cards</h3>
<p id=x024 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/94">Issue 94</a></strong>  Represent Dataset Datasheets with DPV (by coolharsh55) </p>
<p id=x025 class=summary>okay to look into how to represent these using DPV</p>
<p id=x026 class=summary>delaram raised the concern that there are several different variations of datasheets and model cards - which one to use; harsh suggested we look at the information within them and whether DPV can support their expression where the information is in scope; </p>
</section>

<h3 id=t06>AI Act</h3>
<p id=x028 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/106">Issue 106</a></strong>  Propose concepts from the AI Act (by coolharsh55) </p>
<p id=x029 class=summary>delaram has collected the definitions from Art.3 into a spreadsheet for discussion - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WAXH7Bkzu2m2eeOSTyhJBeHp9nst988KYCSRES8xCE/edit#gid=1742301268">https://<wbr>docs.google.com/<wbr>spreadsheets/<wbr>d/<wbr>17WAXH7Bkzu2m2eeOSTyhJBeHp9nst988KYCSRES8xCE/<wbr>edit#gid=1742301268</a></p>
<p id=x030 class=summary>there are 3 versions from Commission, Council, and Parliament</p>
<p id=x031 class=summary>discussion on definitions - there are potentially conflicting/different definitions from AI Act, ISO standards, and OECD; suggestion that the AI Act specific definition be in the AI Act extension and other definitions can be the general concept in DPV or extension</p>
<p id=x032 class=summary>for <code>Intended Purpose</code> - how to model this? The <u>intended</u> prefix is not present in DPV, and the purpose of using AI system is not covered in the current DPV <code>Purpose</code> description; To resolve this, the <code>dpv:Purpose</code> description should be updated to reflect purpose of using data as well as systems/technology which will cover use of AI. Exercise to check whether other concepts should also be updated for this. For <u>intended</u>, we have this as a context rather than only for purpose i.e. a purpose and data and other information can be intended or unintended.</p>
<p id=x033 class=summary>for <code>Purpose</code> vs <code>Capability/Application</code> - the purpose is the end-purpose or the goal of the activity whereas the capability is the technical objective or action; this is similar to how processing reflects actions on data and puropse reflects why the data is being used. </p>
<p id=x034 class=summary>discussion on whether specific concepts should be modelled, e.g. <u>Biometric Categorisation System</u>; harsh suggested that if such concepts have legal relevance i.e. their existence triggers some obligation or additional processes then it is useful to have them - so we should model them. </p>
<p id=x035 class=summary>delaram discussed whether the information in such concepts should be connected to their contituents e.g. <u>Biometric Categorisation</u> to the <u>System</u>; harsh suggested yes; group agreed</p>
<p id=x036 class=summary>legal roles present in AI Act will go in the extension</p>
<p id=x037 class=summary>data concepts e.g. <u>training data</u> - discussion on where to put these? Main DPV, Tech extension?</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t07>AI Extension</h3>
<p id=x039 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/126">Issue 126</a></strong>   AI Extension to provide AI-specific concepts (by coolharsh55) </p>
<p id=x040 class=summary>following from discussion of AI Act, delaram proposed creating a new AI extension as there are lots of AI specific concepts; the group agreed</p>
<p id=x041 class=summary>it will be an extension of the Tech concepts specific to AI, the concepts related to AI such as lifecycles and data will be here; to be discussed next week by delaram</p>
<p id=x042 class=summary>georg asked whether people have worked with Tech extension and Processing concepts; harsh mentioned he had used these to model how the processing was implemented by a technology capable of doing different processing actions and had technical measures; georg mentioned difficulty in doing 'supplier diligence' based on technology provided</p>
<p id=x043 class=summary>the topic of 'supplier due diligence' is relevant to NIS2, DORA, and AI Act - this will be a discussion later with georg and delaram discussing what DPV can do to support this</p>
<p id=x044 class=summary>georg mentioned the following as desirable for using DPV - a way to state use of a system, delivered by a provider or supplier, tech is used in product/service, and then the risk assessment </p>

<h3 id=t08>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x046 class=summary>The next meeting will be in 1 week on WED DEC-06 15:00 WET / 16:00 CET. </p>

<p id=x048 class=summary>Items on the agenda for next week are - <code>Service</code> led by delaram, <code>AI Act</code> led by delaram, <code>AI Extension</code> led by delaram, dpv documentation led by harsh</p>
<p id=x049 class=summary>georg has an upcoming webinar on their Privacy chatbot - see <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2023Nov/0014.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2023Nov/<wbr>0014.html</a></p>
