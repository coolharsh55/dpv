14:26:01 <harsh> Finish DPA https://tietosuoja.fi/en/data-breach-notification
14:27:59 <harsh> harsh: Do we consider time/event existing standards -> yes
14:28:26 <harsh> What events and information do we focus on? E.g. event logs, notifications
14:28:30 <harsh> Jan - we only focus on communications to DPA?
14:28:40 <harsh> harsh:  We have to go for the maximum information that may be required by DPAs so that we support all use-cases. We can then reduce the information required for specific use-cases but the vocabulary will support the entire range.
