00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Optionality Expressed at what 'level'?
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Georg raised the question as to at what level is `optionality` expressed e.g. how deep/high
00:00:00 <harsh> This is relevant for e.g. in a privacy notice the data is indicated to be optional at the top or somewhere in contents
00:00:00 <harsh> harsh: This is dependant on use-cases, any level is possible as use-cases have all kinds of requirements. So it can be used at any level.
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Recipient Country vs Entity Country
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Georg raised the question as to how to distinguish/define the location (country) of recipient as opposed to that of entity
00:00:00 <harsh> harsh: Recipient location as in location of server, processing, etc. is defined has processing (e.g. Storage) and hasLocation it
00:00:00 <harsh> harsh: Entity location is defined as location property on that Entity
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Jurisdictional Concepts
00:00:00 <harsh> Julian raised the topic of representing German federal states and laws as jurisdictional concepts following earlier proposal from harsh
00:00:00 <harsh> In this, the Bavarian region has two DPAs for public and non-public organisations respectively
00:00:00 <harsh> harsh: Suggestion is to simply name them as such e.g. DPA-public and DPA-non-public
00:00:00 <harsh> For state names, it is recommended to follow existing norms or taxonomies e.g. ISO-3166 or EU or countrie's own standardised forms for state names
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Consequence as concept
00:00:00 <harsh> Overlap with ODRL
00:00:00 <harsh> ODRL has the property `consequence` which links a `Duty` to itself, and is a sub-property of `failure`, thereby restricting its use in conditions where the consequences are always `negative`.
00:00:00 <harsh> In DPV, the requirement is to broadly specify the consequence of an action, which can be both `positive` and `negative`
00:00:00 <harsh> Therefore, DPV will declare its own concept, as it cannot adopt the exact inference of ODRL's concepts in this case
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Type of Consequence
00:00:00 <harsh> We discussed `Consequence` as the existence concept, and the requirement to express whether such consequences are `positive` or `negative`.
00:00:00 <harsh> For this, two sets of options were proposed: `Success/Failure` and `Materialisation/NonMaterialisation`
00:00:00 <harsh> Of these, `Success/Failure` were selected based on less ambiguity, more clarity, and intuitiveness
00:00:00 <harsh> Concepts added: `ConsequenceOfSuccess` and `ConsequenceOfFailure`
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Benefits and Beneficiary
00:00:00 <harsh> These concepts were proposed in the first DPVCG meeting / workshop as relevant to determine who `benefits` from processing
00:00:00 <harsh> Proposals consisted of concepts `Benefits` and `Beneficiary` with the properties `hasBenefits` and `hasBeneficiary`
00:00:00 <harsh> In subsequent discussions, it was agreed that the scope should be broader to also include the `opposite` of benefits and beneficiary
00:00:00 <harsh> Examples proposed included: `Detriment` and `Harm`
00:00:00 <harsh> The group discussed the notion of `benefit` being a type of `consequence` and whether it can subsequently be modelled as such
00:00:00 <harsh> Additionally, `beneficiary` would be the `entity impacted by a consequence` thereby avoiding the need to explicitly declare beneficiary as a concept
00:00:00 <harsh> Further discussions related the notion of `Impact` as being distinct from `Consequence` e.g. PersonalDataBreach has the consequence leaked data which then has an impact of identity theft or scams
00:00:00 <harsh> Proposed pattern: X --hasConsequence (neg. isConsequenceFrom) --> Consequence --> hasImpactOn --> Y
00:00:00 <harsh> Proposed pattern: Consequence --hasImpact--> Impact --hasImpactOn--> Y
00:00:00 <harsh> The group agreed the need for further discussion and examples. Harsh will circulate email with a proposal.
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Other Proposed Concepts 
00:00:00 <harsh> `hasResponsibleEntity` - specifying what entity is responsible for something e.g. a controller in a joint controller relationship, or a specific department/division within the organisation (accepted)
00:00:00 <harsh> `OrganisationalUnit` - specifying an unit within an organisation, with the criteria that the unit does not constitute as a separate legal entity in the sense of data controller, data processor, etc. (accepted)
00:00:00 <harsh> `InternationalOrganisation` - As defined in GDPR Art.4-26, and whether this definition is sufficient for a global scope. We invite proposals, otherwise we go with this definition. (conditionally accepted)
