00:00:00 <harsh> Present: harsh, Fajar, Nishad, Piero, Beatriz, Paul, Georg, George, Rana
00:00:00 <harsh> Chair: harsh
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Resolution on DPV suggested usage
00:00:00 <harsh> Piero: RDF treats terms as instances and compliance checking (with OWL) requires classes
00:00:00 <harsh> Piero: shared screen (summary of emails) consent as expression which is then converted to OWL ‘policy’ which can then be converted to other forms
00:00:00 <harsh> Property domain and range restrictions are the ones causing issues since they have incompatibilities such as classes as instances of themselves
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to remove property assertions to ‘free up the vocabulary’, make note that additional assertions/restrictions can be added with caveat emptor about implications from ‘mixing contexts’
00:00:00 <harsh> isExplicit as a boolean property two issues - (i) how to express additional attributes such as ‘freely given’ (ii) what happens if there is no information about isExplicit (open-world)
00:00:00 <harsh> Possible solutions: ExplicitConsent as class ; ConsentType as class with property hasType → discussion on mailing list
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: DPV term-addition and documentation process
00:00:00 <harsh> https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-documentation 
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to Move to DPVCG github (transfer ownership)
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: DPV Use-Cases and Examples
00:00:00 <harsh> What do group members prefer or wish to see in terms of use-cases and examples?
00:00:00 <harsh> Start with simple use-cases e.g. controller uses processor OR processing uses personal data category ; and work up towards the consent policy (as more complex example)
00:00:00 <harsh> TRAPEZE (follow-up) to SPECIAL project, will be developing the technology to a higher maturity level ; and the use-cases can be shared with the group for discussion
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to have different use-cases and examples (not necessarily one for each) for simple and complex use-cases (some of each at the minimum)'''
00:00:00 <harsh> Specifying 'examples' of DPV usage based on use-cases
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to Specify examples in RDFS and OWL for each'''
00:00:00 <harsh> Should we also specify in JSON-LD? Piero: JSON-LD is missing a good way to express the OWL assertions (e.g. union)
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: DPV Primer document
00:00:00 <harsh> We have a primer document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FrPFTRUAreEipvM5hTPPqfnhOl0rBjXpXCMicw9me30/ 
00:00:00 <harsh> Harsh volunteers to author/edit, Beatriz volunteers to help with writing
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Topic: Resolution on Proposed Terms
00:00:00 <harsh> 
00:00:00 <harsh> Discussing rights: GDPR rights in spreadsheet
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to Namespace in dpv-gdpr; Name term IRI as per legal clause reference, label as legal clause + mnemonic ; Create base class ‘Rights’
00:00:00 <harsh> Data subject identity: already exists (as IRI)
00:00:00 <harsh> Data Controller identity: legal requirements require name, address, contact
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to we create properties for name, address, contact with no granularity and specify how to use and how to extend these as needed
00:00:00 <harsh> Automated decision making
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to remove the boolean properties in Processing and add them as classes so that more information can be associated with it
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to add properties for Automated Decision Making regarding decision consequences, logic, human involvement
00:00:00 <harsh> Data transfers and legal basis (adequacy decision in GDPR)
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to For data transfers we can reuse (repurpose) the existing location property (associated currently with storage) to specify location as destination or jurisdiction of the recipient and transfer
00:00:00 <harsh> Agreement to accept the legal basis for adequacy definitions and legal basis for transfers ; add them to the GDPR namespace
00:00:00 <harsh> in the next iteration we have action to identify concepts from these legal bases and see whether we want to add them and where they fit in DPV
